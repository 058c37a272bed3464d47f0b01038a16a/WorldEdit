Compiling
---------

Compiling WorldEdit requires a number of dependencies due to its dual
support for hMod and Bukkit. However, if you only need to compile WorldEdit
for one or the other, then you only need to compile the relevant files.
(Note that the build script doesn't support compiling for only one or
the other yet.)

Requirements:
- JDK 1.6 or newer
- Apache Ant

Main dependencies:
- truezip.jar (TrueZip)
    Downloads at http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/de/schlichtherle/truezip/

hMod dependencies:
- Minecraft_Mod.jar (hMod)
- minecraft_server.jar (Server as distributed by Notch)

Bukkit dependencies:
- minecraft_server_cb.jar (Server as distributed by the Bukkit team; this
    version has classes renamed to be friendly and thus is not compatible
    with Notch's server distribution)
- CraftBukkit.jar
- Bukkit.jar

All of the files for hMod support reside in the default namespace (root
src/ folder). You can choose to not compile those files (or delete them
altogether) if you do not need hMod support.

For Bukkit support, the files can be found in com.sk89q.worldedit.bukkit,
and you can ignore or delete those files if you do not need Bukkit support.
Note that WorldEdit ties itself to CraftBukkit specifically because one,
the Bukkit API currently lacks some features that allow generated trees
to be undone, and second, there is no other implementation of Bukkit (yet).

To compile, place library .jar files into a lib/ folder and run the
Ant build script with the following line:
    ant jar
