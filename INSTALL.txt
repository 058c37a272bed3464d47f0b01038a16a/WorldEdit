Installation
------------

This plugin requires Hey0's server modification.

Create a "plugins" folder in your Hey0's server mod folder and drop
WorldEdit.jar into that folder. Add "WorldEdit" to "plugins" in your
server.properties file, like so:

plugins=WorldEdit

If you have multiple plugins, separate plugin names with commas.
